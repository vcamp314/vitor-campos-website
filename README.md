As this project was created as a demonstration of React - various different aspects of React were touched upon:

You will see in this project examples of class based and functional react components, use of react hooks, refs, life cycle methods, Higher Order Components (HOCs) and more.

Also various popular frameworks were used, such as React Router, Redux, Reactstrap, Styled-Component and React-Transition-Group.

React Unit tests were implemented using Jest and Enzyme.
